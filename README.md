# SQL-Challenges-by-Danny

Till now I have only the basic knowledge of SQL. During my career in BI I have mostly worked with the technical sides of BI tools rahter than the Analyst part.
To strengthen my SQL skills I would be solving Danny's 8 Week Challenge Case Studies.

There is also a course offered by Danny: [**This is Serious SQL**](https://www.datawithdanny.com/courses/serious-sql)
